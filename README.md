The project, “Capacity-Building for Higher Education and the Establishment of Agricultural Genomics Research Center  (AGRC) at the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB),” is set to provide a range of training, exchange and capacity building opportunities for scientists from UPLB, South Korea and IRRI. This is a six-year project, running from November 2021 through October 2027.

By supporting the establishment of the UPLB AGRC, the project will embed the learning and foster further growth of bioinformatics and genomics research and education in the Philippines, to help boost the country’s agricultural competitiveness, and strengthen academic partnerships on genomics and bioinformatics R&D areas.
